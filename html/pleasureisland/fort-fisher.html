                    <h3>A Civil War Historical Monument</h3>
                    <p>Fort Fisher was a civil war fort that protected the North Carolina port town of Wilmington during the civil war.  It kept the port open for blockade runners that supplied much needed supplies to the Confederate army in the area.</p>
                    <p>Fort Fisher fell to a massive amphibious assault on 01/15/1865, and it is believed that it's defeat was a crushing one to the Confederacy. </p>
                    <p>Today, Fort Fisher is maintained as a historic site, with much of the Fort restored for tourism.  The fort offers costumed guided tours, during which players will tell the story of the Confederate artillerists and U.S. infantrymen.  Guides teach participants the 'drill' with wooden rifles.</p>

                    <h3>Historic Structures</h3>
                    <p> Less than ten percent of the earthen fortification remains. Approximately 180 yards of the land face exists on the river side of U.S. 421 and seventy-five yards of the land face exists on the ocean side. The partial remains of Battery Buchanan are at the southern end of Federal Point (just south of the ferry landing).</p>
